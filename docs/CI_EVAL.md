# CI eval client (GitHub Actions)

`.github/workflows/robodojo-eval-client.yml` deploys the RoboDojo simulator container
(`robodojo:<tag>`, built from the root `Dockerfile`) on a self-hosted GPU runner and runs it as
the **evaluation client** against a policy server that is already running somewhere else
(e.g. Pi_05 on the host, in another container, or on another machine).

```
┌─ GitHub runner (self-hosted, GPU) ─────────┐    WebSocket     ┌─ Policy server ─────────────┐
│ robodojo-client container                  │ ◄──────────────► │ XPolicyLab/policy/<POLICY>  │
│ Isaac Sim + tasks + scoring                │   host:port      │ robodojo.sh server          │
└────────────────────────────────────────────┘                  └─────────────────────────────┘
```

The workflow does **not** start the policy server. Start it first, bound to `0.0.0.0`, e.g.:

```bash
bash scripts/robodojo.sh server --policy-dir XPolicyLab/policy/Pi_05 \
  --task stack_bowls --ckpt <CKPT> --policy-env <ENV> --policy-port 9999
```

## 1. Runner setup (one time)

GitHub-hosted runners have no NVIDIA GPU and too little disk, so use a **self-hosted** Linux
runner:

| Need | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Labels | `self-hosted`, `linux`, `gpu`, `robodojo` |
| GPU / driver | NVIDIA driver ≥ 570 (CUDA 12.8) |
| Docker | Docker Engine + NVIDIA Container Toolkit: `sudo bash docker/install_docker_nvidia.sh`; add the runner user to the `docker` group and restart the runner service |
| Disk | 300 GB+ free (image ≈ 200 GB plus build cache) |
| Tools | `git`, `python3` (≥ 3.8, standard library only), `bash`, `timeout` |
| Network | TCP access from the runner to the policy server host/port |

Prepare the persistent assets and cache directories once:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules <repo> /data/robodojo/src && cd /data/robodojo/src
bash scripts/init_assets.sh          # downloads Assets/ (also writes curobo.yml with absolute paths)
mkdir -p /data/robodojo/cache
```

Then set these **repository (or organization) variables**
(*Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables*):

| Variable | Example | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ROBODOJO_ASSETS_DIR` | `/data/robodojo/src/Assets` | Persistent `Assets/` mounted read-only into the client |
| `ROBODOJO_CACHE_DIR` | `/data/robodojo/cache` | Warp/Omniverse caches reused across runs (avoids multi-minute cold starts) |
| `ROBODOJO_ASSETS_BAKED_DIR` | *(optional)* | Path baked into `Assets/Robots/**/curobo.yml`. Auto-detected; only set if detection fails |
| `ROBODOJO_ENV_CFG` | *(optional, `arx_x5`)* | env_cfg stem |
| `ROBODOJO_ENV_GPU` | *(optional, `0`)* | Isaac Sim GPU id on the runner |
| `ROBODOJO_IMAGE_TAG` | *(optional, `cuda12.8`)* | Client image `robodojo:<tag>` |

The custom runner labels are declared in `.github/actionlint.yaml` so `actionlint` accepts them.

**Why Assets is mounted twice:** the curobo robot configs contain absolute paths from the
location where `init_assets.sh` ran. The helper mounts the assets at
`/workspace/RoboDojo/Assets` and also at that original path, so those paths resolve inside the
container. Don't move `Assets/` after initializing it, or re-run
`python3 utils/update_embodiment_config_path.py` from the new repo root.

## 2. Run it

*Actions → RoboDojo eval client → Run workflow*. Inputs:

| Input | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `policy_name` | `Pi_05` | Directory under `XPolicyLab/policy/` (needs `deploy.py`) |
| `policy_host` | `127.0.0.1` | Where the policy server runs, **as seen from the runner** (see below) |
| `policy_port` | `9999` | The `--policy-port` the server was started with |
| `ckpt` | `external` | Label recorded in result paths |
| `tasks` | `stack_bowls` | Comma list; leave empty to use `dimension` |
| `dimension` | — | `generalization`, `memory`, `precision`, `long-horizon`, `open`, `all` |
| `eval_num` | `1` | Integer, or `native` for per-task counts from `_task.yml` |
| `action_type` | `ee` | Must match the checkpoint (`ee` or `joint`) |
| `seed` | `0` | Eval / layout seed |
| `rebuild_image` | `false` | Force a `docker build` (otherwise only built when missing, ~1 h) |

GitHub limits manual (`workflow_dispatch`) runs to 10 inputs, so `env_cfg`, `env_gpu`, and
`image_tag` come from the repository variables above. When the workflow is called with
`workflow_call`, they can also be passed as inputs, which take precedence over the variables.

**Choosing `policy_host`.** The client container uses `--network host`, so the address is
resolved from the runner machine itself:

| Policy server runs on… | `policy_host` |
| --- | --- |
| the same machine as the runner (host or a `--network host` container) | `127.0.0.1` (default) |
| another machine on the LAN | that machine's IP, e.g. `192.168.1.50` (`hostname -I` on it) |
| a remote/cloud machine | its public IP or DNS name (port must be open in its firewall) |

The server must be started with `--bind-host 0.0.0.0` (the default) to be reachable from
another machine. Check from the runner with `nc -vz <host> <port>`.

Or from the CLI:

```bash
gh workflow run robodojo-eval-client.yml \
  -f policy_host=10.0.0.5 -f policy_port=9999 -f ckpt=pi05_robodojo -f tasks=stack_bowls -f eval_num=1
```

The workflow is also `workflow_call`-able, so another workflow can start the policy server and
then call this one.

## 3. What the workflow does

1. **prepare**: checks out the repo with submodules, validates inputs and resolves the task
   list (`scripts/ci/resolve_eval_inputs.py`), checks the policy adapter exists, checks the GPU
   on the host and in a container, builds the image if missing, checks the assets, and runs
   `robodojo.sh doctor` inside the image.
2. **eval**: a matrix with one job per task and `max-parallel: 1`, since one Isaac Sim fits on
   a GPU. Each job waits for the policy server port and runs the client container
   (`scripts/ci/robodojo_ci.sh run-task`). The container is always removed afterwards. A task
   passes only if the client exits `0` **and** a `_result.json` from this run has
   `eval_time >= 1`. Results and `client.log` are uploaded as the `result-<task>` artifact.
3. **summarize**: merges the artifacts, writes a PASS/FAIL table (and the
   `summarize_result.py` leaderboard table if enough episodes exist) to the job summary, and
   uploads `robodojo-eval-summary`.

Runs share the concurrency group `robodojo-gpu-eval`, so they queue instead of competing for
the GPU. The workflow has no `push`/`pull_request` triggers, so a self-hosted runner never
executes fork code. Inputs reach scripts only through environment variables and are validated
first.

## 4. Running the same steps locally

Every step is a plain script that works without GitHub:

```bash
export ROBODOJO_ASSETS_DIR=$PWD/Assets ROBODOJO_CACHE_DIR=$HOME/.cache/robodojo-ci
export TASK=stack_bowls POLICY_NAME=Pi_05 POLICY_HOST=127.0.0.1 POLICY_PORT=9999 CKPT=<CKPT>
bash scripts/ci/robodojo_ci.sh check-gpu
bash scripts/ci/robodojo_ci.sh ensure-image
bash scripts/ci/robodojo_ci.sh run-task --dry-run   # print the docker command
bash scripts/ci/robodojo_ci.sh run-task
bash scripts/ci/robodojo_ci.sh report
```

## 5. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| `policy server ... not reachable` | Server not started, bound to `127.0.0.1`, wrong port, or a firewall is blocking it. Check with `nc -vz <host> <port>` on the runner. |
| `submodule ... is empty` during the build | The checkout must include submodules. The workflow does this; for local builds run `git submodule update --init --recursive`. |
| `ValueError: .../X5A.urdf is not a file` | The baked curobo path wasn't mounted. Set `ROBODOJO_ASSETS_BAKED_DIR` to the `<dir>/Assets` shown in `Assets/Robots/**/curobo.yml`. |
| First run very slow | Cold Warp/Omniverse caches. They persist in `ROBODOJO_CACHE_DIR` after the first run. |
| OOM | The policy server and Isaac Sim share a GPU. Run the server on another GPU or machine, or set `env_gpu`. |
| Leftover container after a cancel | `docker ps -a --filter name=robodojo-client-` then `docker rm -f <name>`. The cleanup step does this automatically. |
